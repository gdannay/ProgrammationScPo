Tyler's Comments

2016.09.25 - Nice job! Thanks for giving all the homeworks a try. Additioanlly
your code is really nicely commented and documented. It's very good! Take
a look at the corrections to see what I expected from the problems, but keep
up the good work!

2016.10.03 - HW4 - Nice job Gregory. The matrix calculations take a bit of
getting used to, so take a look at the solution and compare your answer. I
think the last question was unclear for most people.

2016.10.25 - HW5 - Great job. Hope the tests went well. Have a good break!

2016.11.05 - HW7 and HW8 - only 7 submitted. I looked at your code and if
you are trying to calculate the proportion of each gender killed, you should
consider what will be the dimension of your result. You should get a single
number (a scalar) representing the number of men killed divided by the total
number of deaths. You could calculate this by summing the gender column
and dividing by its length. If you would then like to associate this number
to each individual based on their gender you could create a new column and
fill it conditionally. I hope you give this another try and let me know how
it goes!
