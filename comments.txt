Tyler's Comments

2016.09.25 - Nice job! Thanks for giving all the homeworks a try. Additioanlly
your code is really nicely commented and documented. It's very good! Take
a look at the corrections to see what I expected from the problems, but keep
up the good work!

2016.10.03 - HW4 - Nice job Gregory. The matrix calculations take a bit of
getting used to, so take a look at the solution and compare your answer. I
think the last question was unclear for most people.
